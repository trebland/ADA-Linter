# ADA-Linter

Improving ADA Compliance And Web Accessibility Through Linting.

## Current State

ADA Linter is experimental and may cease development at any time; however, I intend to take this project to the point of having a simple yet viable ada linter for easy build checks and in-line code recommendations.

Versioning is largely for testing purposes and may contain breaking changes that don't follow semantic versioning. After having a stable release, this repository will convert to semantic versioning.

## Help

If you stumbled across this looking for something to help you lint, please feel free to follow the progress here or look at [pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y) for an immediately usable and free tool.
